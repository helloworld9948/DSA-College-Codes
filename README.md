## Course Outcomes

- Ability to develop C programs for computing and real-life applications using basic elements like control statements, arrays, functions, pointers, and strings, and data structures like stacks, queues, and linked lists.
- Ability to implement searching and sorting algorithms.

## List of Experiments

1. Write a program that uses functions to perform the following operations on a singly linked list:
   - i) Creation
   - ii) Insertion
   - iii) Deletion
   - iv) Traversal

2. Write a program that uses functions to perform the following operations on a doubly linked list:
   - i) Creation
   - ii) Insertion
   - iii) Deletion
   - iv) Traversal

3. Write a program that uses functions to perform the following operations on a circular linked list:
   - i) Creation
   - ii) Insertion
   - iii) Deletion
   - iv) Traversal

4. Write a program that implements stack (its operations) using:
   - i) Arrays
   - ii) Pointers

5. Write a program that implements Queue (its operations) using:
   - i) Arrays
   - ii) Pointers

6. Write a program that implements the following sorting methods to sort a given list of integers in ascending order:
   - i) Quick sort
   - ii) Heap sort
   - iii) Merge sort

7. Write a program to implement the tree traversal methods (Recursive and Non-Recursive).
